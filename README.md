Python Text File Browser

A python text file browser.  
Currently works only with windows.
It has been developed in python 3.5.2.  Testing is limited, and is only done for new features.  And by testing, I mean trying it out.  ;-)

I tried it out in python 2.7.3, and it doesn't work.  Sorry to make you sad, python2 people.

That is my only wishes for using this.
